# Human Activity Recognition from Sensors Data  
## ðŸ“– Overview

This project implements **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using sensor data collected from smartphones. The dataset contains data from accelerometers and gyroscopes, and the goal is to classify activities such as walking, sitting, standing, etc., using machine learning and deep learning models.  The dataset used is the **UCI HAR Dataset**, a widely recognized benchmark for HAR tasks.  ---
